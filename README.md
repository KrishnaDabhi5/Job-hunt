🚀 Automating My Job Hunt with n8n:
Finding relevant internships manually every day can be time-consuming — so I decided to automate it! 🧠
Here’s how my Job Hunt Automation System works:
⚙️ Tech Stack:
n8n for workflow automation
Google Sheets for user configuration
SerpAPI to fetch job listings
Custom JS scoring logic to rank jobs based on:
Skill Match
Location Preference
Job Type
Recency
Keyword Relevance
Airtable for storing and tracking all results
Telegram Bot for daily notifications with top matches 📱
💡 How it works (automatically every morning at 9 AM):
 1️⃣ Reads my profile and job preferences from Google Sheets
 2️⃣ Searches jobs across multiple platforms via Google Jobs
 3️⃣ Scores and filters results (min match ≥ 60%)
 4️⃣ Saves top matches to Airtable
 5️⃣ Sends me a daily job digest via Telegram — complete with company name, title, and direct apply links 🔗
🧩 Output:
A structured Airtable dashboard with all job details
Instant Telegram message with the top 5 high-match roles
Automated and consistent job discovery — no manual searching needed!
This project taught me how to blend automation, APIs, and data processing for real-world productivity gains.
